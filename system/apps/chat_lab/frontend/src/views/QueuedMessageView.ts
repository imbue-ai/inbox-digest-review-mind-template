/**
 * Renders the queued-message group: the messages the harness has parked while the
 * agent is mid-turn, under a subtle header row.
 *
 * The frontend is dumb here -- it renders a full snapshot the backend pushes on
 * the agents WebSocket (``AgentState.queued_messages``) and holds no queued state
 * of its own. The only action on the group is [Shoulder tap]: it fires ONE
 * harness-agnostic intent (`POST /shoulder-tap-atomic`, which the backend dispatches
 * per harness) and paints nothing locally -- the next backend queue snapshot and the
 * committed turn reflect the result. Whether the tap is AVAILABLE is entirely the
 * backend's call, reported as ``shoulder_tap_available``; that flag alone greys the
 * button, so it can never be pressed in a state the backend would refuse (no error
 * path). The only thing the frontend adds is a local guard against double-firing its
 * own in-flight request.
 * (Interrupt-to-composer lives on the composer's Stop button -- see MessageInput.)
 * There is no harness branch anywhere in here.
 *
 * A published entry is not necessarily a PARKED one: the backend flags an entry it is
 * about to type, or is typing, as ``is_sending``, and such an entry renders as the
 * "Sending…" bubble rather than a queued chip. A snapshot that is entirely ``is_sending``
 * therefore gets no group chrome at all -- see ``renderQueuedMessages``.
