/**
 * The location-beacon boundary: the one place the shell listens for messages
 * from the workspace's own framed apps.
 *
 * This is the second sanctioned cross-frame message surface, beside the embed
 * contract (`src/embed.ts`, which owns the chrome<->workspace channel): a
 * framed app posts `{type: "minds-location", path}` to `window.parent` -- one
 * hop up, which is this shell -- on each page load, so the instance it shows
 * can reopen at the same place (see the vendored file viewer's beacon and the
 * `build-app` scaffold). It lives in its own module for the same reason the
 * embed contract does: every raw `message` listener is confined by the embed
 * ratchet (`test_embed_ratchets.py`) to an allowlisted file, so the whole
 * surface stays greppable and auditable, source checks included.
 *
 * The shell trusts nothing about a beacon: the origin must be one of this
 * workspace's own service origins (derived from the registry exactly as the
 * panes' URLs are), the posting window must belong to a pane this dock is
 * rendering, and that pane must show an app instance -- the only objects with
 * a location to keep. What survives is stored by the instance's ref,
 * machine-wide (see models/MemberLocations).
