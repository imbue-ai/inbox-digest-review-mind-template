/**
 * Ephemeral, client-only "Sending…" bubbles -- the ONE optimistic state the
 * frontend is permitted to invent (contract A2). One is painted at the tail of the
 * transcript the instant the user POSTs a message, before the backend's own state
 * (its queued chip, or the committed transcript turn) catches up.
 *
 * Removal is BACKEND-DRIVEN and ORDERED, never timed: the backend reports the
 * message's real representation -- a live transcript ``user_message`` arriving, or a
 * new entry in the harness queue snapshot -- and ``noteBackendArrivals`` drops the
 * oldest bubble as each genuinely-new real item appears. The real representation is
 * already rendered when its id reaches here, so the real one shows FIRST and only
 * then is "Sending…" removed: the message is always visible in some form
 * ("reconciliation goes through the message", A2), never a gap. Correlation is
 * positional (oldest-first) with arrival-id dedup; there is no content matching, and
 * over-eager removal is harmless -- the real bubble is what shows.
 *
 * A send FAILURE is NOT rendered here: the caller drops the bubble (``dropOutgoing``)
 * and handles failure the original way -- a popup plus restoring the text to the
 * composer. A bubble that somehow never sees an arrival dies on reload; there is no
 * frontend timer, and it never gates real state.
