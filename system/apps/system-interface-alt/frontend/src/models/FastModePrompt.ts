/**
 * State for the fast-mode grace-period prompt.
 *
 * The workspace's first chat launches with fast mode on (the `first` create
 * template) so the opening conversation feels responsive. Fast mode costs more
 * per token, so once that chat has run its grace period (see fast-mode-prompt.ts)
 * the user is asked whether to keep it -- once per agent, ever. Any exit from the
 * modal records the answer; only "switch to standard speed" also changes the
 * agent's live setting. The answer never affects later creates: no other chat
 * launches fast in the first place.
 *
 * The durable record is the agent label `fast_mode_prompt_answered=true`
 * (written via the backend latch endpoint). Labels reach the frontend with the
 * next observe relist, which can lag by minutes on an idle workspace, so an
 * in-session set of answered agent ids suppresses the prompt in the meantime.
