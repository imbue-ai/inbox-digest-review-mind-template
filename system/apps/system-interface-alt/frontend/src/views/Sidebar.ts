/**
 * The project rail: the narrow strip down the left edge of the workspace that
 * says which view you are in and lists everything that view holds.
 *
 * At rest it is a 37px icon strip showing only the view's glyph and the
 * shortcut icons; the pointer entering expands it to a 240px panel that floats
 * over the dock (150ms width transition, labels fading in, overlay elevation
 * shadow). The labels are always in the DOM -- they only transition between
 * `opacity-0` and `opacity-100` -- which is what makes the expansion one
 * width/opacity animation rather than a reflow, and the icons sit in a
 * fixed-width leading box so nothing shifts while it runs. The rail is
 * absolutely positioned inside a 37px slot for the same reason: expanding
 * overlays the dock instead of shoving it sideways every time the mouse passes.
 * It collapses again on pointer leave, but stays open while any of its menus is
 * open, since those extend past its own edge.
 *
 * A **view** is either a project (a filter over the machine's objects plus its
 * own layout) or Everything (the unfiltered view, and the home). The rail draws
 * both identically -- the only differences are that Everything has no settings
 * and that nothing can be removed from it, because it is where an object lives
 * when no project shows it.
 *
 * The rail opens nothing itself. The workspace owns panel creation, membership
 * and every destroy verb, so each row calls back with what the user picked (see
 * SidebarAttrs) and the workspace decides what that means -- including raising
 * the confirmation in front of anything destructive.
