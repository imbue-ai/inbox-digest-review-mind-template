 * The mockup's class strings, copied verbatim.
 *
 * `prototypes/minds-harness` is the design source for the provider chooser, and this app
 * runs the same Tailwind v4 with the same `@theme` hexes -- `#e4e3df` border, `#2f6b4f`
 * accent, `#202020` primary text, `#666666` secondary, `#8c8c8c` tertiary -- so the
 * mockup's classes port across unchanged. Keeping them here as literals, rather than
 * re-deriving equivalent CSS, is what keeps a later diff against the mockup meaningful.
 *
 * Source, file by file:
 *   PANEL / HEADER / SCROLL / CHOOSER_ROW*   IntroChooserModal.tsx

 *  fixed body height gave a two-line confirmation six hundred pixels of white space under it.
 *
 *  Height is CONTENT-driven, not set: the overlay centers rather than stretches, the body has
