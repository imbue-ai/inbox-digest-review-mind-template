/**
 * The New Tab launcher: a full-page panel replacing both the "+" dropdown and
 * the empty-state overlay.
 *
 * It answers one question -- what do you want in this pane -- in three parts:
 * "Open new" starts something from scratch, "In this project" jumps to
 * something the active view already shows, and "On this machine" reaches
 * everything else the machine holds, whether it is filed in other projects or
 * in none at all.
 *
 * Opening a row from "On this machine" ADDS it to the active project and takes
 * it from nowhere: a project is a view, membership is many-to-many, and the
 * same object may be shown by any number of projects at once. The launcher does
 * not perform that itself -- it only reports which half of the split the row
 * came from, and the caller shares it in (``shareMember``) before opening the
 * panel, because the caller is the one that owns panel creation. That is also
 * why nothing here knows about dockview: every input arrives as an attr and
 * every action leaves as a callback (the same idiom as Sidebar and
 * AllAppsPicker).
 *
 * Everything is the unfiltered view, so it has no member list to split against:
 * there, "In this project" would be the whole machine and "On this machine"
 * would be empty. The launcher renders the single machine-wide table instead
 * (see buildLauncherSections), and opening a row from it changes no membership.
 *
 * The list building, kind filtering and recency ordering are exported as pure
 * functions above the component so they can be tested without a DOM, and so the
 * machine enumeration stays shared with the sidebar (buildLauncherRows is built
 * on Projects' buildEverythingMembers, and the member rows arrive from the same
 * source as the rail's tab list -- see buildLauncherSections).
