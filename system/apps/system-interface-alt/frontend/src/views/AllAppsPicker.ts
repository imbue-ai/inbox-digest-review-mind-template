/**
 * The rail's "All apps" popover: every app on the machine the active project
 * has not already pinned.
 *
 * Pinning an app to a project IS its membership -- an app is pinned exactly
 * when the project's member list holds its `service:<name>` ref, and there is
 * no second pin state anywhere. A pinned app is already visible in the rail's
 * own shortcut rows (with its own hover-revealed unpin affordance -- see
 * `pinnedAppRow` in Sidebar.ts), so listing it here too would just be the same
 * row twice; this popover exists for the OTHER apps, the ones a visit here is
 * actually for. Deliberately UNFILTERED against what is already open, though:
 * membership is many-to-many, so an app another project shows is an ordinary
 * pinnable row here, and pinning it adds it to the view you are looking at
 * without taking it from anywhere.
 *
 * Clicking a row opens the app. Hovering one reveals a pin toggle that adds
 * the project's membership (there is nothing to unpin from in here -- see
 * above). The popover deliberately stays open afterward so several apps can be
 * pinned in one visit, which means the row just clicked has to disappear from
 * under the pointer: `ROW_FADE_DURATION_MS` keeps it rendered, collapsing and
 * fading, for one transition's worth of time after the click rather than
 * pulling it the instant the project's member list catches up, so neighboring
 * rows ease upward instead of snapping a different app under a pointer that
 * has not moved. This component only reports the toggle; the rail files it
 * server-side, and a failed pin leaves the row back where it was (see the
 * `rows` computation in `view`) rather than losing it.
 *
 * Everything is the unfiltered view and pins nothing -- its rail already
 * shows a fixed shortcut row for every openable app -- so under it the
 * popover has nothing left to list and shows its already-pinned empty state.
 *
 * The popover renders as a bare card and is placed by the rail, which owns the
 * one floating-menu placement (flip, clamp) every one of its menus uses. It
 * does not close itself either: the rail holds the flag that mounts it, closes
 * it when an app is opened, and keeps it open while apps are being pinned.
 *
 * No update listener is needed: AgentManager redraws after every WebSocket
 * event, so reading `getApps()` inside `view` picks up an `apps_updated`
 * broadcast on its own.
