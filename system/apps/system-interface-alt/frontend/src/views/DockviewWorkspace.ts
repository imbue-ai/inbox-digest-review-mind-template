/**
 * The dock: one DockviewComponent holding the tabs of whichever *view* is
 * mounted, plus the bookkeeping that ties those tabs to the machine.
 *
 * A view is either a project (a filter over the machine's objects plus its own
 * saved arrangement) or Everything (the unfiltered view, and the home). Both
 * mount here identically -- switching saves the outgoing arrangement and loads
 * the incoming one -- and the only difference is membership: a project has an
 * explicit member list, and Everything has none because it shows whatever the
 * machine holds.
 *
 * Membership is many-to-many and nothing owns anything, so the rules the dock
 * enforces are narrow:
 *   - opening an object in a project adds it to that project's member list;
 *   - closing a tab changes no membership and stops nothing -- the object keeps
 *     running, backgrounded, and the sidebar keeps listing it;
 *   - destroying is the one thing that reaches across views: the object is gone
 *     from the machine, so it leaves every project's saved content and member
 *     list at once.
 *
 * The dock is never empty. A view with no panels gets a New Tab launcher, which
 * is also what the "+" opens and what a freshly-created project lands on.

 * files no member and its page is keyed by its panel -- so on first mount it
 * is adopted: the allocator mints the app's lowest free instance, the pane
 * takes the name (re-keying its live page, exactly as a terminal's late
 * session-name allocation does), the ordinary auto-membership path files it,
 * and the next autosave persists the adoption. Browser panes (session-keyed)
 * and terminal panes (session-named, no serviceName) are not app panes and
 * are skipped; a failed allocation leaves the pane as it was, and the next
 * mount retries.
 *
 * Adoption is deliberately per pane, per view: a legacy app that was open in
 * two projects -- one shared page pre-instances -- becomes two independent
 * instances, one minted at each view's first mount. Nothing is lost (both
 * panes keep working, each filed into its own project), but the old
 * shared-page identity is not preserved; adopting into an existing instance
 * instead would risk colliding two legacy panes of one app inside one view.
 *
 * CLEANUP: drop this pass once no supported workspace's saved layouts predate
 * app instances (every pane saved since carries ``serviceInstanceId``).

 * the agent's ``display_name`` label with its canonical form as the agent's
 * true name, the same pairing a create establishes -- and stores every other
 * kind in the machine's title store keyed by the object's ref (see
 * models/MemberTitles). Either way the name belongs to the object, not to this
 * view's saved layout, so every view showing it says the same thing and an
 * object with no panel anywhere -- backgrounded, or filed in no project at all
 * -- can be named too. Nothing is written to ``panelParams``: ``params.title``
 * stays the *derived* name, which is what the tab falls back to if the chosen
 * one is ever cleared.
 *
 * The tab strip is repainted here rather than waiting for the broadcast that
 * follows, so this client settles immediately; the broadcast repaints every
 * other one (and this one again, harmlessly). Twice, though, and the first one
 * is the point: ``setMemberTitle`` is optimistic -- it files the typed name
 * before the server has agreed to it -- but a dock tab's title is not mithril's
 * to repaint, it moves only when ``panel.api.setTitle`` is called, which is
 * what ``syncTabTitlesFromStore`` does. Syncing only after the round trip would
 * leave the tab the user typed into showing the old name for the seconds
 * ``mngr rename`` takes, while the rail beside it already said the new one. The
 * second sync settles the strip on whatever the server answered -- the stored
 * name, or the old one a refusal has already put back.
 *
 * Throws with the server's detail when the rename is refused: both callers
 * await it and report the rejection their own way -- an alert on the tab
